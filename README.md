# Crop-Disease-Detection
Trained and Tested a Multicrop disease detection application using tensorflow and keras.
The model uses Convolutional Neural Network to extract and classify the images, it uses max pooling for feature extraction and has 15 convolutional layers.
The model is trained on 46,616 images and tested on 11,653 images belonging to 25 classes.
The training output data is stored in a keras file there to be tested.
